Description: 

implements a simple encoding and decoding scheme for ASCII text.  Each character in the text (including whitespace characters) is represented as a variably-sized group of single-digit decimal integers.  
The first number in the group gives the number of numbers in the rest of the group. 
 Each of the rest of the numbers corresponds to a set bit in a char value represented by the group. 
 The bits are numbered from 0 to 7 going from lowest to highest order.  
For example, the character 'A', which has ASCII code 65 (in decimal notation), would be encoded as:

206

—meaning that there are two bits set—the 0th bit and the 6th bit. Following is an encoding of "BC":

2163016213

The first character has two bits set: 1 and 6:

0100 0010

This gives hexadecimal 0x42, which is character 'B'.  Next we have a character code with three bits set: 0, 1, and 6:

0100 0011 = 0x43 = 'C'

Finally, we have

0000 1010 = 0x0a = '\n'

The encoding does not include a final NULL character because the file reading routine (to be covered in class) does not read a final NULL.
