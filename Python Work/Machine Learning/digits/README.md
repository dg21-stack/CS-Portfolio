Objective: Train an algorithm on the 'digits' dataset in order for computer to recognize digits drawn in MSPaint

Learning Algorithm trained on the built in dataset in the keras module.
After training, tests of accuracy were made off of the randomly selected test set.
After confirmation that the test set was accurately returning the correct answers, numerous images were created in ms-paint
with dimensions (28,28) using the brush tool. 
Algorithm successfully returns proper image.
Algorithm sometimes struggles on 8 or 0, otherwise, it is accurate.
